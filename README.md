# substr-vs-substring

Can't remember how javascript's `"string".substr(a, b)` and `"string".substring(a, b)` worked? Quick open the console and
try them out, or see [here](https://tipdbmp.github.io/substr-vs-substring/), or if you like to read:

* [substr](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr)
* [substring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substring)
